# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) challenges, implemented in C++.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each day's challenge is organized into separate folders for Part 1 and Part 2:

```
aoc/
├── Day1/
│   ├── part1/
│   │   ├── day1part1.cpp    # Solution code
│   │   ├── d1p1.txt         # Input file
│   │   └── day1_part1_submission.png # Submission screenshot
│   └── part2/
│       ├── day1part2.cpp
│       ├── d1p2.txt
│       └── day1_part2_submission.png
├── Day2/
│   ├── part1/
│   └── part2/
├── Day3/
│   ├── part1/
│   └── part2/
├── Day4/
│   ├── part1/
│   └── part2/
├── Day5/
│   ├── part1/
│   └── part2/
├── Day6/
│   ├── part1/
```

## 🚀 How to Compile and Run

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)
- Standard C++ library support

### Compilation

Navigate to the specific day and part folder, then compile:

```bash
# Example for Day 1, Part 1
cd Day1/part1
g++ -o day1part1 day1part1.cpp
```

### Execution

After compilation, run the executable:

```bash
./day1part1
```

**Note:** Make sure your input file (e.g., `d1p1.txt`) is in the same directory as the executable, or update the file path in the source code accordingly.

## 📝 Notes

- Each solution reads input from a text file in the same directory
- Solutions are written in standard C++ using STL containers and algorithms
- Submission screenshots are included for completed challenges
- Input files are included in the repository (add your own input file from Advent of Code)
